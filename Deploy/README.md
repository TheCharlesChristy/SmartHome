# SmartHome Deployment

## Overview
The Deploy directory contains the production-ready code for SmartHome, primarily implemented in C/C++. This environment is optimized for handling sensor data and managing control signals in a robust, resource-efficient manner.

## Purpose
- **Optimized Performance:** Deliver reliable and efficient performance under real-world conditions.
- **Stability and Robustness:** Ensure the control system operates consistently with high stability.
- **Scalability:** Efficiently manage large volumes of sensor data and control commands for medium-weight computers.
- **Integration:** Serve as the final stage for validated prototypes from the Prototype directory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C/C++ Compiler:** Ensure a suitable C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC) is installed.
- **Build Tools:** Required build tools can be installed or configured as needed.
- **Dependencies:** Check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation for any specific dependency guidelines.

### Building the Deployment
1. Open a terminal in this directory.
2. Run the build script for your platform:
    - On Unix-like systems:
    ```bash
    ./build.sh
    ```
    - On Windows:
    ```bash
    ./build.ps1
    ```
3. Observe the build output for any errors or warnings, make sure the executable is generated successfully.

### Running the Deployment
Once built, run the production executable by:
```bash
./SmartHome
```
Observe the output in the terminal for sensor data processing and control signal status.

### Directory Structure
- **src/:** Contains the C/C++ source files for production.
- **include/:** Contains header files for the C/C++ deployment.
- **tests/:** Unit tests for production components.
- **docs/:** Documentation and design specifications for the deployment.
- **build.*:** Build scripts for different platforms (e.g., build.sh for Unix-like systems, build.ps1 for Windows).

### Contributing
Contributions to the deployment are welcome. To contribute:
- Fork the repository and create a new branch.
- Refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for contribution and coding style guidelines.
- Make your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Submit a pull request for review.

### License
The deployment is part of the open source SmartHome project. Please refer to the main LICENSE for details.

### Future Enhancements
- Further optimize code for low latency and high throughput.
- Extend error handling and logging for improved resilience.
- Integrate advanced scheduling and resource management features.
