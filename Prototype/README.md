# SmartHome Prototype

## Overview
The Prototype directory contains early development code for SmartHome, primarily implemented in Python. This prototyping environment allows rapid iteration, testing, and validation of sensor and controller interfaces before moving to the production-ready C/C++ deployment.

## Purpose
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly try out new ideas and refine sensor and controller interactions.
- **Testing:** Validate integration and communication logic during early development.
- **Feedback:** Collect insights and performance metrics to guide production implementations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x** installed.
- Required Python packages can be installed via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Prototype
1. Open a terminal in this directory.
2. Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```
3. Observe the console for output related to sensor readings and control signals.

## Directory Structure
 - src/: Contains Python source files for the prototype.
 - tests/: Unit tests for prototyping components.
 - docs/: Supporting documentation and design notes.
 - data/: Sample data or configuration files.
 - requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies.
