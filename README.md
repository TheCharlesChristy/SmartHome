# SmartHome

## Overview
SmartHome is a modular and efficient system designed to run on medium weight computers. It handles incoming messages from a large array of sensor devices and manages control signals to adjust the environment based on sensor readings.

## Key Features
- **Modularity:** Easily integrate new sensor and controller interfaces.
- **Efficiency:** Optimized for speed and resource management.
- **Scalability:** Capable of handling data from numerous sensor devices.
- **Web Integration:** Future plans include adding web-based control once the core functionalities are complete.

## Technologies
- **Prototyping:** Python is used for early development and testing.
- **Deployment:** C/C++ will be used for the core control system in production.

## Installation
Installation is streamlined with provided quality-of-life scripts:
- Unix-like systems: Use the provided `.sh` scripts.
- Windows: Use the provided `.ps1` scripts.

## Usage
1. Run the prototyping version to test sensor and controller interfaces.
2. Transition to the optimized C/C++ deployment once core functionalities are verified.
3. Use the QOL scripts to simplify the installation and setup process.
